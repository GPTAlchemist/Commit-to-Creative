## 🧩 Summary
Commit to Creative is a style-enforcing post-generation assistant that transforms GitHub content into platform-aware, human-authored social posts. It doesn’t polish your voice — it protects it. Built to eliminate generic AI-speak, this GPT tool listens to your tone, honors your phrasing, and structures the message without rewriting your intent.

## ❓ Problem Statement
AI-generated posts often sound like they were... AI-generated. Too polished. Too vague. Not nearly reflective of the creator who built the thing. Most tools over-summarize or decorate what you said — instead of helping you say it right. The result? Posts that feel algorithmic, not authored.

## 🧪 Solution Overview
Commit to Creative lets developers talk about their projects without turning into content marketers. It takes your README, launch note, or feature description and gives it shape — tailored for a specific platform — while locking in your original tone. Powered by two tone-enforcement documents, the tool uses your input as a signal, not just as content.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🧭 **Platform-Specific Structuring**: Adapts output for "professional space," "developer blog," or "casual tech community"
- 🧬 **Style Enforcement Anchors**: Uses `Andrew's Writing Style.txt` and `The Driftage Paradox.txt` to suppress generic AI phrasing and reflect a grounded, reflective writing tone
- 🧾 **Clarification-First Intake**: Prompts for missing tone, platform, or post type to avoid misfiring tone or structure
- 🧱 **Structured Output**:
  - Optional headline or hook
  - Main body (based on platform logic)
  - Platform-aware CTA
  - **Mandatory footer** for transparency

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights
- 🧠 **Verbatim Input Preservation**: Treats user content as a live tone signal — not just text to rewrite
- 🚫 **No Hallucination Policy**: Never invents phrases; falls back to reference files if input tone is weak
- 🔐 **Hard Style Lock**: All outputs filtered through uploaded reference tone files
- ⛔ **Zero Passive Templates**: No vague filler or bland AI summaries

## 🚀 Results or Differentiators
- ✍️ Posts feel authored — not assembled
- 📈 Higher engagement from real-sounding narratives
- 🧃 Doesn’t hide automation — embraces it with a structured footer
- 🥇 First to use embedded tone filters over prompt tricks or fine-tunes

## 💡 Final Note
Commit to Creative isn’t here to be clever — it’s here to be clear. It’s a structure tool, not a rewrite engine. It protects your tone, amplifies your message, and gets out of your way.
